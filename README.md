# DALI Data Science Challenge
## Jusung Park

This challenge utilized machine learning models to predict course enrollments and classify courses based on median GPA points using the provided `Dartmouth - Courses.csv`. Using Python and the scikit-learn library, the analysis used regression and classification techniques.

The analysis is divided into two main sections:

1. **Predicting Course Enrollments**: Implementing regression models (Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor) to forecast enrollment numbers based on various course attributes.
2. **Classifying Courses by Median GPA**: Applying classification models (Random Forest Classifier) to categorize courses into High, Medium, and Low GPA groups, and evaluating model performance through precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
